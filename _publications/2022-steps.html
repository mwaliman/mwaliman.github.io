Ambulatory disability is common in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Remote monitoring using average daily step count (STEPS) can assess physical activity (activity) and disability in MS. STEPS correlates with conventional metrics such as the expanded disability status scale (Expanded Disability Status Scale; EDSS), Timed-25 Foot walk (T25FW) and timed up and go (TUG). However, while STEPS as a summative measure characterizes the number of steps taken over a day, it does not reflect variability and intensity of activity
